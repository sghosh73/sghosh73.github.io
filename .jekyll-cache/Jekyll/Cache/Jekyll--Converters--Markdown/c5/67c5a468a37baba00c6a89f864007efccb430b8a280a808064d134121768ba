I"Ã<p>Hello!</p>

<p>I am currently a 4th year PhD Student at the <a href="https://usc.edu">University of Southern California</a>.</p>

<p>These days, I am very interested in LLM evaluation, characterizing LLM behaviors by analyzing their longform text outputs, test-time scaling, and finding out whether we can better control the trade-off between the peaky distributions induced by alignment and the wilder, untamed distributions learnt by base models.</p>

<p>Previously, I was a research engineer at <a href="https://asapp.com">ASAPP</a>. I studied Math and Computer Science at the <a href="https://umich.edu">University of Michigan</a>, where I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/">David Jurgens</a> and <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~chaijy/">Joyce Chai</a>. I worked on several projects in areas ranging from pragmatics, sociolinguistics, network theory, and bias/fairness.</p>

<p>I am always willing to help and advise undergrad or masters students interested in NLP research. If you are interested in collaborating, please email me at <a href="mailto:ghoshsay@usc.edu">ghoshsay@usc.edu</a>!</p>

<p>Here is a current <a href="/assets/pdf/sghosh_cv.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
