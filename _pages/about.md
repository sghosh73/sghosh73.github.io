Hello!

I am currently a 4th year PhD Student at the [University of Southern California](https://usc.edu).

These days, I am very interested in LLM evaluation, characterizing LLM behaviors by analyzing their longform text outputs, test-time scaling, and finding out whether we can better control the trade-off between the peaky distributions induced by alignment and the wilder, untamed distributions learnt by base models.


Previously, I was a research engineer at [ASAPP](https://asapp.com). I studied Math and Computer Science at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu), where I was fortunate to be advised by [David Jurgens](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/) and [Joyce Chai](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~chaijy/). I worked on several projects in areas ranging from pragmatics, sociolinguistics, network theory, and bias/fairness.

I am always willing to help and advise undergrad or masters students interested in NLP research. If you are interested in collaborating, please email me at [ghoshsay@usc.edu](mailto:ghoshsay@usc.edu)!

Here is a current [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/sghosh_cv.pdf).
